Pushing Changes to GitHub

Once you have made changes to your code, you can push them to your GitHub repository directly from VS Code.

Stage and Commit Changes: Go to the Source Control view. Type a commit message in the input box. Click on the "Commit" button to commit your changes locally.

Push Changes: Click on the "Sync Changes" button to push your local commits to the remote repository. If you haven't configured your Git username and email, VS Code will prompt you to do so.
